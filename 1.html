            I dreamed that it was the end of the world and everyone needed to
            play hard to survive. Setting looked like my primary school. My mom
            and my grandparents were locked in a building that I escaped from.
            They were chilling on the third floor balcony even though they were
            about to be purged if they lost the games (rounds and rounds of
            survival competitions, cue Saw). My grandma even winked at me when
            we made eye contact. I headed into the music building with someone
            who wanted to kill me, I don't know if I managed to get rid of them
            but through an all-knowing perspective I saw my family beating a big
            red female Santa in a challenge. It was gruesome but I was relieved.
            I woke up.
