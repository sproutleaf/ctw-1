            I dreamed about people in the distant past, physical challenges,
            injuries, me being helpless in the process. Today's my last day at
            home and I've been feeling the tension between nostalgia and the
            inexorable movement of time; almost resistant to the idea that we
            cannot go back to the past (when I was carefree) & I'll have to be
            responsible, independent, a "real adult" in the future (very Saturn
            Return of me LOL). Scared of screwing up and ruining everything i
            cherish? 心有敬畏，应该也不是坏事吧。
