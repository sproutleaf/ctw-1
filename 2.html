            I dreamed that we were in my parents' old bedroom. A crowd of people
            rushed in from the bottom of the building, begging us to open the
            door and take them refuge because there's a bear invasion outside.
            We didn't do anything. In a fit of transposed anger, they shattered
            the glass door. Then they stopped, abruptly. All the banging,
            fidgeting, shouting ceased into radio silence; they smashed the door
            but didn't even bother to come in. Instead, they dispersed to the
            sides and left room for the starving bears to come into our room, as
            i witnessed them dragging your severed body out half-alive.
