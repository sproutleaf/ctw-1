            I dreamed that I was at my ex's wedding. They were both dressed in
            gorgeous, pristine white. I was trying so hard to get out of there—I
            wasn’t invited; I didn’t want to be there; I shouldn’t be there. As
            I was running away, one of his relatives came up to me and
            whispered: See how happy they are now? It would have never happened
            with you.” My head hurt so much I woke up.
