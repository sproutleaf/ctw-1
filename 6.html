            I dreamed that I was pregnant, very pregnant at that. I navigated
            the world with an unfamiliar heaviness and a constant pain; I can
            feel another life’s hunger and movement in me. I peed on a pregnancy
            test with delusional hope that I was indeed not pregnant, just to
            see two strips appearing in an instant, loud and quick to laugh at
            my absurdity. I told my mom I was pregnant and she asked, who’s the
            father? I told her I don’t know — that it could be him or him or
            him; she had no discernable reaction. I woke up with a subdued pain
            in my belly because dreams can be visceral like that.
