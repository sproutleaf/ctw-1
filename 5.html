            I dreamed that my mom was gone. I think she passed away but everyone
            hid it from me. I was searching for her in a frenzy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="dream">
            When I woke up, I thought about what she said to me when I was home
            over the winter, “If your parents are still alive—even if it’s only
            one of them—you’ll always feel like a child. You're entitled to that
            feeling. But once they’re both gone, you can never come home again.
            There's no more comfort or protection, only somewhere for you to
            disappear into.”
