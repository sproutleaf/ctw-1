            I dreamed that I was having dinner at an endlessly long table
            covered in white tablecloth and silver utensils with some friends
            and my ex suddenly joined me and I felt so repulsed and nauseous and
            ran away. Back home, my mom was gifted a huge, ugly sloth with red
            eyes and dirty nails. He moves like a snail with no trail behind,
            hangs from a blown-up bonsai tree all day. I felt disgusted all over
            again and begged my mom to return him. I woke up feeling so drained.
